<p><b>Book miniatures: Sontag, <i>Under the Sign of Saturn</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Hereâ€™s an essay in the form of a sonnet. </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>It is hard to write about Sontag, partly because Sontag herself is so <i>good</i>, writing with a simple and effortless fluidity, an understated, playful elegance that you know you will never be able to match. Partly because her writing always, gently but irresistibly, draws you away from her own text and into the text she is writing about, and what she is writing about is always a text, for her. Sontag is so good that you constantly want to put her down to finally read Benjamin again, or Barthes, and how come it never even crossed your mind to read Artaud. There is something self-effacing about her style, not because Sontag is a timid writer but because she creates a vast web between texts of which her individual essays end up forming only a small part.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Sontag is a horizontal, not a vertical thinker. She is not interested in higher, more abstract layers of meaning, in generalizing, in asking the Big Questions. She is like Kierkegaard chastising Hegel for wanting to go beyond religion, to find a deeper truth hidden behind it, when religion is all we need. What she writes about is the text and nothing but the text, as it is, in all its immanence. In her hands, text takes on a concrete, corporeal presence that she explores with boundless patience and curiosity, like a child captivated by a pebble or a leaf of grass. The goal is not to go beyond but to come closer, to see even more, to make the web even denser.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>It is hard, for me, to read Sontag, because I have woefully little patience and sometimes not a whole lot of curiosity for things that are small and concrete and corporeal. I do want to go beyond, to staple abstraction upon abstraction. I only feel at home in outer space. Sontag always seems to be telling me that what I like to think of as a strength is a weakness, a mere inability to focus on what is up close, escapism of the bad sort. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>To consider this a personal preference would be like considering it a personal preference to be religious. (There is a sense in which it is true, but it is a trivial one.) I have wondered whether there could be a synthesis, a single underlying principle of thought taking two different shapes, only to realize that I have, again, formed an abstraction, run away from what is up close. And so Sontag keeps on sitting uncomfortably in the back of my head, for now. </p>
