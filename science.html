<p><b>What science is not about</b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I’m relating here a conversation I had during an open house visit for a PhD program in Linguistics to which I had just been accepted. (This was back in 2021; hence, everything was virtual.) I ended up choosing a different department for a number of reasons that largely have nothing to do with the following.</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>So I’m having a one-on-one with a professor in my subfield of Linguistics (theoretical syntax) who is moderately famous (for the standards of Linguistics) as well as unusually old (for any standards). Our meeting takes place right after his syntax lecture, which I was genuinely impressed by. He is an impressive figure. He is also perfectly likeable. We are talking about the way he teaches syntax (he likes to start with older approaches, the first CFG’s, GB, P&P, and then goes on to demonstrate how, by building on those ideas, we arrived at the point where the theory is now) and I ask, partly out of genuine interest and partly in the attempt to maintain a civilized and intelligent conversation with an authority figure, whether he also ever teaches non-mainstream theories, meaning LFG, HPSG, CCG, etc., basically anything other than time slices of orthodox Chomskyanism. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>He informs me that he does not, that furthermore he does not consider these theories worth pursuing, and that if this is what I am interested in, I should maybe consider choosing a different department. It’s a bit hard to tell how upset exactly he is due to the substantial amount of pandemic beard obscuring his face. I scramble to explain that I have no intentions of pursuing any of this full-time but that I imagined there might be some sort of vague intellectual value in engaging with competing theoretical approaches. I tell him about this class on Dynamic Syntax (as non-orthodox as anything) which I went to at SOAS while I was at UCL, and while DS is not a framework I buy into at the end of the day, learning about it felt exciting and perspective-broadening and bigger-picture-clarifying and like something a good syntactician should do?</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>He shifts in his chair and tells me that I’m still young, so it’s fine that I’m playing around with different ideas, but now that I’m starting grad school I really need to pick a theory and stick with it. Never change it. And in particular, I should make sure to pick the theory that most people work on [NB – the wording here is quite literally his], because, he argues, hardly any non-linguists have even the faintest idea of how theoretical linguists spend their time [which, if I may briefly interrupt him here, is correct] and if I worked in a non-standard framework, I couldn’t even explain my thoughts to most fellow linguists. As a result of which I would have no friends, and would end up being lonely and sad. I interpret his facial hair at this point to convey some genuine concern for my well-being.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>What I found remarkable and kind of mindblowing about this conversation is the fact that a successful and well-respected senior researcher would not only acknowledge that our theoretical affiliations are often the result of socio- and psychological dynamics much more than being rooted in evidence or arguments or falsifiability or any other hardcore science value of your choice, but even explicitly advise to let former considerations take precedence over the latter. It’s easy to take this anecdote as evidence that mainstream generative linguistics is indeed rotten to the core and only survives because the field is largely populated by opportunists who shrewdly choose to endorse the theory that maximizes their social capital (as well as, probably, their chances for tenure), but I doubt that Chomskyans are the only species in which this behavior has been observed. And while I remember being shocked by how my bearded interlocutor above seemed to callously sacrifice the pursuit of truth to the pursuit of happiness (what if I’m happy to be sad if it gets science places?), the fact that we all, consciously or not, hold certain views in part for perfectly contingent, science-external reasons (your alma mater, your friends, your personality, etc.) is naive to deny and too trivial to even point out. As a caveat, I do believe that apparent clashes between theories are to a considerable extent differences in perspective and terminology and level of description rather than genuine disagreements and I’m all in favour of mixing and matching and transcending different frameworks, but this does not entail that we are all on the same page; some clashes are clashes. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>It’s no fun to contemplate the fact that you probably don’t have particularly good reasons for holding the beliefs you hold. It’s reassuring to remember that maybe you don’t need to. In an ideal world, it should be possible to determine which side in a debate has the stronger arguments even if everyone involved in it is just desperately trying to get tenure, in the same way that the outcome of a baseball game should tell you who the better team is even though nobody plays with this goal in mind but everybody, obviously, just tries to win. (All of this of course only works under the assumption that everyone nevertheless adheres to the rules of the game, which I reckon is where we enter the non-ideal world.) Why you hold the beliefs you hold and even which beliefs you hold in the first place then doesn’t really matter because at the end of the day none of this is about you, or about whether you win or lose. This is all just about the game, and the beauty of it, and the fun. </p>
