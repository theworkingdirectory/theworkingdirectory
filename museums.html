<p><b>How to spend a day at an art museum</b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>This is a painfully exhaustive summary of all the factors to consider when spending longer stretches of time at an art museum which I found helpful to summarize for myself. Some of them are practical, others less so, many quite obvious. The following is based on my experience as a diligent but dilettante [sorry] museum-goer without an art history degree. It is mostly geared at large-scale whole-day places like the Met, the MFA or the Louvre; parts of it also apply to somewhat different circumstances.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>This is the first in a series of How To posts. I don’t know yet whether there will be further instalments of this series. Essentially, this is a pilot.</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Prepare</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Spending an entire day just looking at things requires a decent amount of preparation. Most down-to-earth things first, wear shoes which you are positive your feet can tolerate over several hours. In summer, bring a jumper. Museums are often maintained at more or less the same slightly chilly temperature all year, partly in the interest of the artworks, and I have been miserable many times in a T-shirt. Check in advance which bags are allowed inside and whether you can bring bottled water. If not, bring it anyway and hide it in your bag; bags are often not checked, and rarely thoroughly. (Regardless of whether or not your water has entered the museum legally or illegally, obviously don’t drink in the galleries themselves, including in what you consider a safe distance from the artworks. It makes the guards nervous, and their job is tedious enough.) While probably no serious art museum will allow you to bring food, I consider it in line with the spirit of the law to smuggle in small amounts of high-density food (nuts, chocolate, etc.) in the interest of maintaining reasonable levels of blood sugar throughout the day without having to rely entirely on the food sold inside. However, unless the museum includes some sort of unsupervised outdoor area, you might have to consume illegal food in the restrooms, which isn’t for everyone I suppose. I also bring a notebook and a pencil, and I would definitely bring noise-cancelling headphones if I had any. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Structure </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Take breaks, a lot. Museum visits are exhausting, mentally and physically. Stay hydrated, eat regularly and have a well-timed coffee at some point. At many museums you can exit and re-enter the same day with the same ticket (but not everywhere – check upon arrival), which allows you to a) take advantage of lunch opportunities outside and b) take a walk. If this is not an option, find a quiet hallway or garden to do some stretching (or a full-blown yoga routine if that’s your thing and the hallway/garden of your choice is quiet enough), unless you happen to be immune to the kind of neck and lower back pain that the less fortunate of us develop after a few hours of standing and peering slightly upwards. It makes me feel like a philistine to pay attention to these things but fact is that investing some thought and effort into avoiding physical discomfort during the day puts you in a better position to engage with the works on display. You are most likely not going to have any sort of aesthetic revelation with a headache.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Get an overview over the available exhibitions at the beginning, or even before you arrive, in order to spare yourself the frustration of discovering a really exciting Japanese print collection ten minutes before closing time. Unless the museum is genuinely tiny, don’t try and see everything (which I am regularly tempted to do because it promises closure and achievement and just being done with something for once). This is very much a personal preference, but I usually allot each section I want to see a certain amount of time (say, 75 minutes in contemporary sculpture, 50 minutes in Italian Renaissance, etc.) and simply move on when (approximately) the time is up. Any point at which I move on feels arbitrary and premature anyway, and this strategy prevents me from getting stuck in some galleries. Go see your favourites but also make time for being surprised by works you did not anticipate being all too keen on. I tend to mix different sections in a way that maximizes the contrast between them rather than proceeding chronologically or otherwise coherently (e.g., moving from Italian Renaissance not to Italian Baroque but to Chinese pottery) so I don’t arrive at the point where all works just blend and blur into one hazy vision of madonnas and chiaroscuro. I strongly recommend avoiding crowds by targeting the more popular sections during off-peak hours: particularly crowded sections are typically, if applicable, impressionism and its friends and relations, surrealism, pop art and anything unusually famous; particularly quiet sections tend to be anything non-Western, non-painting (exception: Rodin) or pre-14th century. I usually spend the last hour of my visit randomly roaming around the sections I had no time for at all and saying goodbye to my favourites. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Look </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>It is always painful to state the obvious, but different works require different ways of looking. Some want to be studied in detail, others to be gazed at from afar, some tell you a story, others a riddle, some need you to understand their past, others their future, some invite you in and others deliberately shut you out and ask you what it’s like on the other side. They all ask for more time than you have to spare for them and you are under no obligation to allot your resources fairly. You will invariably encounter works you find bewildering or ugly or plain boring, and in some museums this might be the majority. There is no reason to fall prey to the two most common, and equally pointless, reactions to this experience, viz., a) to blame the artwork for being bewildering or ugly or plain boring, or b) to blame yourself for lacking the education or intelligence or whatnot needed to appreciate the artwork and see beyond the bewildering and ugly and plain boring. Not understanding a work is by far a more interesting experience than understanding a work, if the latter is taken to mean subsuming it under what you are already familiar with. Not understanding a work is kind of the reason why you’re here. It means that the object you’re staring at is somehow fundamentally incompatible and incongruous with the person you are right now, and it forces you to reconfigure yourself to make space for this object. All of this being said, there is again no obligation to enter into an intimate dialogue with every work in the museum in the same way that there is no obligation to be friends with every person in the world. Sometimes, it’s just not a match.  </p>
