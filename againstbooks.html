<p><b>Against books</b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I’m trying to write more often without overthinking it in order to get into the habit of writing. This is a short (i.e., short to write) companion piece to the book miniature series and also another post in which I try to understand what certain words mean. I felt like trying on the following line of argument to see how it fits. </i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>I’m not opposed to books. I have friends who read books. But I am sometimes puzzled by the way we talk about books <i>qua</i> books. A book, stripped down to its essence, is just a codex, a particular way of materially packaging text. Most of the time when people talk about books, they really mean only very specific kinds of books, mostly novels and certain genres of nonfiction, in addition to, perhaps, poetry collections – in short, the kinds of books that you would sit down and read from cover to cover in your spare time. This is the kind of activity people seem to mean when they list ‘reading’ or ‘reading books’ as a hobby. Reading textbooks, cookbooks, notebooks and phone books does not usually qualify as reading books. I’m a stickler and find this terminologically unsatisfying, but I can live with the idea that the concept of books has a prototype structure and that we sometimes use the word to pick out only the very center of that structure, which is fine. I will call these prototypical books shbooks, just to be clear. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>What I find at least curious is the fairly unconditional reverence we have for shbooks. Reading a shbook is generally considered a good use of your time, in particular compared to any sort of screen-based activity. Habitually reading shbooks means you’re sophisticated. The reverence also extends metonymically from the text of the shbook to the object itself, to which some people seem to have a slightly fetishistic attachment. (Which is fine. There are definitely worse fetishes. I’m just trying to understand.) I can’t think of any other physical medium capable of encoding written or spoken text (CDs, scrolls, leaflets, USB sticks, posters, etc.) which enjoys a similar status. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>To reiterate, I don’t want to take away anyone’s fetish, but the fact is that a lot of shbooks are bad, by any measure you could reasonably apply. It is also a fact that there is non-shbook writing, including some screen-based texts, which is very good. (Consider this blog post! Doesn’t <i>War and Peace</i> pale in comparison?) But speaking strictly for myself, I don’t put half as much attention and effort into an essay published in a magazine or online, even a good one, as I do into a proper shbook, even a bad one. I probably finish less than 30% of all articles or podcasts that I start but around 99% of shbooks. Once a text comes in the form of a shbook, it has a claim to be taken seriously. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Much of this has to do with length. The short story is generally considered to be a lesser genre than the novel, and the essay than the shbook-length monograph. In some areas of academia, you need to have published a book [sic] to qualify for tenure, as if an argument that does not stretch over 200+ pages is not fully worth considering. This is a strange view of things. In ancient Greco-Roman rhetoric, <i>brevitas</i> was considered a core skill to be deliberately practiced. I once listened to a podcast interview with an expert on a particular period of Chinese philosophy (the details of which I don’t recall because it was a podcast that I didn’t listen to all too carefully) who explained that to understand the writing of that time, you must first rid yourself of the idea of the book and of the idea of the author. Someone back then who had some sort of philosophical insight would simply write it down as a short text – maybe a few hundred words, probably not more than 2000 – and then, without signing it, pass it on to a friend. This friend might then add some equally brief reply and pass it on to someone else, and so forth. The entire philosophical work from this period of Chinese history takes this form but by by today’s Western standards, it would all amount to little more than a random blog post with some comments. On that note, there is a tendency to attribute the apparently low quality of debates on Twitter/X (not speaking from experience) to the fact that a tweet can only contain so many characters and thus, the argument goes, of course must be simplistic and shallow and not an insightful contribution. But there are plenty of genres that would fit into a tweet, from epigrams and aphorisms to sutras and haikus. There is nothing wrong with brevity itself, quite the opposite.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I’m not opposed to shbooks, or books, for that matter. I just wish that we, by which I largely mean myself, could have the same reverence and careful attention towards any other kind of text as well, regardless of its length and regardless of the medium in which it is presented, and I wish this would hold true of readers as well as of writers. I also don’t want to give a text credit just because it comes in the form of a shbook. Besides, I have friends who don’t read shbooks, which is fine.</p>
