<p><b>Book miniatures: Céline, <i>Voyage au bout de la nuit</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>More book miniatures, no more pretensions to minimization.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Voyage au bout de la nuit</i> is not the kind of novel that has a plot in the strict sense. It has a narrator, Ferdinand, who recounts his life, closely mirroring Céline’s own. We first encounter Ferdinand as a young medical student who volunteers to join the French army in World War I but soon decides that he does not want to die for a war that he realizes is utterly meaningless. He comes to identify as a coward the way other people identify as a Trotskyist: cowardice, he believes, is the only attitude that is legitimate and not utterly meaningless in these times. It is safe to say that Ferdinand is not a likeable guy, and he does not try to be. It would be meaningless. He ends up being hospitalized with what seems like genuine shell shock, is shipped off to an African colony that is somehow even worse than the war, manages to escape – through a horrible stint as a galley slave – to the United States, where he suffers from poverty, exploitation and homesickness, and finally returns to France to finish his medical studies and sets up his practice in Rancy, a shabby Parisian suburb. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>This is not the happy ending. We are at about page 300 out of 500 at this point and it is here that things begin to get seriously depressing. The patients are poor and unable to pay. Ferdinand’s reputation as a doctor is not the best, leaving him only with the hopeless cases that the other doctors will not take. Life is bleak. Poverty has made the people of Rancy bitter, petty and cynical. Ferdinand has reached the miserable stasis of midlife, with no direction, no meaning, no deeper point in all of it. Faut se débrouiller. Eventually, he leaves Rancy and takes a job in a mental asylum, which provides some stability, more stasis, no meaning, no happy ending. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>


<p>All of this would qualify as prototypical literary realism if it weren’t for Robinson. Léon Robinson is Ferdinand’s <i>Doppelgänger</i> who makes an appearance everywhere – in the war, in the colonies, in the States, in Rancy, in the asylum, his life a twisted and distorted version of Ferdinand’s. He is an imaginary figure inserted into a real world. While Ferdinand is working as a doctor in Rancy, a married couple, the Henrouilles, try to persuade him to declare Monsieur Henrouille’s elderly mother insane so that she can be put in an asylum. As Ferdinand refuses, Robinson is instead hired to kill the old woman. Ferdinand, when he learns of the attempted murder, reacts with a vague sense of disgust but does not intervene, having long since lost any illusions of moral rectitude. But the murder goes wrong and Robinson is blinded in the attempt. In order to avoid rumours spreading, Robinson and the old Madame Henrouille are sent together to Toulouse where they make a good living by, of all things, running a crypt filled with the mummified remains of Catholic saints, charging admission to pious visitors. Robinson slowly regains his eyesight, no longer tolerates the old woman taking more than her share of the profits and kills her, this time successfully. In the meantime, he has also acquired a fiancée. He eventually leaves her, having become disgusted, as he says, by love itself. She shoots him: the novel ends with his death. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>


<p>In any other novel this would be a plot but here it is not. It’s just things that happen. A plot is a line that has a single dimension, a single direction, leading you from the beginning of a novel to its end. Some novels have many lines and they cross and tangle and end abruptly, but those are still lines. A life, on the other hand, is a plane, stretching out in all directions. Turning a life into a plot requires a reduction in dimensionality which Céline is not interested in. Things just happen, some big and some small, some remarkable and some mundane and tedious, and none of them receives special treatment. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>


<p>So what is the point of it all? Ferdinand ponders at some point: <i>C’est peut-être ça qu’on cherche à travers la vie, rien que cela, le plus grand chagrin possible pour devenir soi-même avant de mourir.</i> Maybe this is what we are looking for throughout life, nothing but this, the greatest grief possible to become ourselves before we die. And later: <i>C’est comme une femme qui sérait affreuse la Peine, et qu’on aurait épousée. Peut-être que c’est mieux encore de finir par l’aimer un peu que de s’épuiser à la battre pendant la vie entière.</i> Misery is like a terrible woman you would have married. It might be better to end up loving her a little than to wear yourself out beating her up your entire life. Any attempts at attaining happiness, joy, fun and love that we sporadically witness throughout the text are thwarted. Worse even, they feel trite, tasteless and, as Robinson ultimately discovers, disgusting. Trying to look on the bright side of life in the face of hardship is not a heroic act but idiotic and bad style. There is no point in fighting the ugliness of all of it. And yet it is precisely through embracing this ugliness, misery and utter meaninglessness that Céline writes a text that at times comes closer to the definition of beauty than anything else I know.</p>
