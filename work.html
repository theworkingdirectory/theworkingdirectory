<p><b>Work</b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Something that’s been on my mind recently is the nature of work, what qualifies as work and what doesn’t, and what we mean by calling something work. This is my attempt at clarifying the concept, which is only very partially successful.</i></p> 

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Here’s a first shot at a definition of work which seems perfectly obvious: work is what pays the bills. Work is how you make a living. However, there are some equally obvious holes in this first-shot definition, one of them being unpaid care work, given that it has dawned on most of us that the people who cook our meals, clean our homes and raise our kids for free are not not working. And this is without even getting into unpaid interns and so forth. Whatever it is that defines work, money is not it.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>We could take a Marxist turn here and define work (or, using the proper Marxist terminology, labour, which I suppose means something slightly different but I can’t put my finger on what) as any activities that generate value. This would give us a way of dealing with care work, being (re-)defined in some feminist varieties of Marxism as reproductive labour (compared to the [non-re]productive labour happening in factories and workshops, etc.), which reproduces the forces of production which in turn produce value, reproductive labour being consequently also value-producing and properly speaking work, q.e.d. Which is nice, but I’m not convinced that this gets us very far in understanding what in natural everyday language is and isn’t called work. Leaving aside that I never really bought into value theory (and leaving aside even further that I understand it too poorly to actually be entitled to any opinion here), the reason why mowing your lawn is work while going for a walk is not seems to have little to do with their respective ramifications for economy at large. It’s just that one of them <i>feels</i> like work. (I’m also wondering whether going for a walk, by virtue of possibly having a positive effect on the walker’s mental health, shouldn’t also be considered reproductive labour which enables said walker to happily keep on contributing to the GDP 40h/w, but this seems a pointless tangent.)</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Hence, an alternative definition which might be better in tune with everyday usage is that work is whatever is hard. Not necessarily unpleasant all the time – plenty of people would say they enjoy their work – but <i>hard</i>, tiring, exhausting, costing you effort and energy, sweat and tears, being the kind of thing that sometimes you don’t want to do but have to do anyways. Non-work is time off, leisure, rest. The seventh day. I think the problem with this line of argument lies not so much in the idea that work is hard but rather that non-work is not. There is certainly the idea floating around that free time is ideally spent in a roughly horizontal state steadily consuming food and beverages and content like the Epicurean gods in a state of blissful inactivity, but this just does not exhaust what people choose to devote their non-work hours to. People play chess, read Joyce, run marathons and learn Japanese in their free time. These things are hard, sometimes frustrating and often not immediately gratifying (sorry, James). The idea that in the absence of external pressures, people naturally revert to some sort of minimum entropy state is both factually false and a deeply depressing view on human nature. So this seems a dead end as well. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I’m sure that there is actually a sizeable academic literature out there recounting the intellectual history of work, the origins of the concept, how it evolved over time, how it relates to similar notions (labour, <i>negotium</i>, <i>Maloche</i>, etc.), all of which I haven’t even tried to look up because a) I’m a dissertation-stage grad student and shouldn’t be spending time doing research for my blog and b) it would probably make this post immediately feel painfully amateurish and redundant and futile. However, my best guess is that our current concept of work comes from mid-20th century male white collar work: someone leaving home in the morning to drive to his spatially separated Workplace where he executes exclusively Work-related activities, while evenings and weekends are devoted equally exclusively to non-[Work-related] activities such as eating meals that an unpaid care worker has prepared for him, watching TV and going to baseball matches. If it weren’t for the fact that such a someone might occasionally have to clean the gutters, which of his activities qualify as work would be perfectly clear-cut precisely due to the fact that all even potentially work-like activities that are unrelated to his paid employment have been carefully excised from his lifestyle. It’s odd that our current discourse around work still seems so deeply indebted to this schema which arguably never applied to a whole lot of people, and nowadays to very few.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>On this note, I’d like to take this opportunity to very briefly rant about the idea of work-life balance, which has become a beloved staple of contemporary discourse on mental health but which seeks to restore exactly this rigid and nonsensical separation between Work and Life which maybe was a feasible lifestyle for Joe Doe from the fifties but seems a weird structure to try and fit a contemporary life into. I do get that people find it helpful to not check their work emails over breakfast, but this has little to do with the idea that Work and Life (the latter being a terminological choice which continues to bewilder me) are completely separate realms which shall never cross but rather with the very commonsensical insight that stressful thoughts in general should probably not invade your life beyond necessity. Which does indeed mean not checking your work emails over breakfast but also means not worrying about tax deadlines or ailing pets (concerns belonging unequivocally to the domain of Life) at your child’s birthday party. I don’t really see that you need a well-defined boundary between Work and Life to avoid becoming a stressed and anxious mess, and the hopeless attempt to set up such a boundary would turn me into a stressed and anxious mess if I tried. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>At this point, we might just content ourselves with defining work as a socially contested concept with fuzzy boundaries, united through family resemblance, situated within a complex discourse, having deep historical roots, etc., all of which is obviously not wrong and arguably even correct. However, I find this boring and unsatisfying, so here’s one last shot at a definition. Work is what commands respect. The phrase ‘I’m working’ are magic words which make anyone who has strolled into your room leave on tiptoes. Work is what gets you out of a dinner invitation with no hard feelings. Work is serious. Work is what, at least in a certain sense, you couldn’t get out of even if you tried. The point here is not that all activities commonly deemed work are inherently important and valuable and that all those which are usually denied this label are not, because the point is not about what work is like at all. The point is about what we do when we call something work, what kind of act we perform. Calling something work means stating that you’re doing something demanding and serious and asking for it to be acknowledged. Work is indeed not defined as whatever gets paid, but there might be a case to be made that work is whatever we feel should get paid.  </p>
