<p><b>How to not buy clothes</b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I was planning to write another How to post but then felt uncomfortable and pretentious giving any sort of advice on this issue, so the post turned into something slightly different. </i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>I decided to stop buying new clothes about ten years ago. My clothes come from thrift stores, flea markets, tag sales, swap shops and cardboard boxes that my neighbors leave on the curb, besides items I have inherited from friends, housemates and family members. I make exceptions for the obvious (socks, etc.). For the first two or three years the rule was tough to stick to and I broke it occasionally; by now I’m quite used to it. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I like to think of my rule as a boycott of an industry that sucks in pretty much any way imaginable, but I have to admit that it is hardly an adequate response. A lot of the issues surrounding the garment industry have to do with working conditions and labor rights, and the way to address them is not through boycotts but through active organizing and lobbying. More generally, and even more trivially, fixing fashion requires political action on a larger scale, not just individuals adjusting their personal consumption habits. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the environmental impact of clothing is massive along several dimensions (carbon footprint, water use, pollution from dyes, discarded clothes ending up in landfills, etc.) and that we simply need to scale down production and slow down consumption. Buying fewer clothes is a sensible thing to do. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Another thing I have to admit is that this is easier for me to do than for most people, for several reasons. (What now follows is an almost unbearably obnoxious checking-my-privilege discussion.) I live in a town with a ridiculously high density of thrift shops. I’m a grad student in a field that doesn’t care much for formality (I used to have a professor who regularly lectured in sweatpants). Unless I’m visiting my grandparents I can pretty much wear whatever I want, including clothes that fall somewhere between worn-out and ragged. If you have an employer who expects you to look neat and respectable, this is not an option. There’s also the issue of size. If you rely on used clothes, you usually can’t choose between the same item in different sizes, so you develop a pretty flexible understanding of fit. I’ve gotten very good at cutting off, tucking in, rolling up, or just going for a baggy style. (One of the reasons why second-hand shoes are tricky – they actually need to be exactly your size.) But all of this only works for clothes that are larger than your actual size; wearing a smaller size is rarely ever a good idea, if physically possible at all. The bottom line is, the larger your size, the fewer options you have, and this is even without taking into account that large sizes are generally harder to find even in regular stores. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>And then there’s class. Not everyone likes the way I dress and I know that some people (aka my mom) find it vaguely morally reprehensible but I don’t think that anyone takes my patched shirts as evidence that I can’t afford anything else. What this means is that I don’t get treated with the special kind of contempt and disrespect we reserve for what I’m going to awkwardly label the less affluent. I’m not really qualified to speak from this perspective but my understanding is that for a whole lot of people, wearing clothes that are new and fashionable is a matter of respect, not only of getting respect from other people but also of reminding yourself that you are a person worthy of respect in the first place, which society apparently wants you to forget. Wearing used clothes is only fun if it is a choice, and somehow it becomes yet another way of asserting your status and displaying your cultural capital. I’ve been told that in computer science, the most famous and successful people have the crudest, ugliest, most amateurish personal websites. The logic is the same. Which makes me feel weird about my patched shirts, but buying new shirts doesn’t exactly seem like a solution either in the grand scheme of things. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Speaking of feeling weird and moving somewhat abruptly from the societal to the personal level: while I care about the environmental impact of the fashion industry, I do also care about how I look, and not being able to optimize my appearance by taking advantage of the cheaply available wonders of capitalism like everyone else can be frustrating. I’m not sure if this experience has somehow made me more accepting towards my non-optimized appearance. This is not a post where I end up extolling the virtues of Being yourself and Looks don’t matter and all that. I don’t really buy into the idea that fashion is just a cover for our true identities that we’re too insecure to display openly. Fashion is a way of positioning yourself in the social system, a statement that communicates what kind of person you think you are. You can’t opt out of fashion because you cannot not communicate; you’re always saying <i>something</i>. Even dressing in a completely standard, careless way that prioritizes physical comfort above all else because you’re indifferent or even hostile to the rules of fashion is equivalent to going through life with a sign around your neck saying that you consider yourself the kind of person who doesn’t care about fashion, with all that this (probabilistically) entails. Which is a perfectly valid statement, but it is a statement nonetheless. There’s no point in pretending that you occupy some kind of unmarked ground zero. More broadly, the idea that you could somehow forge your own identity in total isolation from the people around you (as appealing as I personally find it) contradicts both Hegel and common sense. You become yourself through the ways you relate to others, and deliberately ignoring them is one such way. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Which means that we are all collectively stuck with having to get dressed every morning, putting together a person that fits more or less comfortably and in which we can get through the day. The point of not buying new clothes is simply that it turns this whole exercise from a fairly bleak frenzy of obligatory consumption into what at its best can feel like a creative challenge, a sort of bricolage. You are, after all, tasked with making the best out of what other people consider trash. The goal is no longer to create a person who is both optimized in every possible way and absolutely authentically you. The goal is just to have fun creating, anything, any you. </p>
