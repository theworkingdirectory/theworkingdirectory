<p><b>Book miniatures: Labatut, <i>When We Cease to Understand the World</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>This is a curious book, a collection of short stories, dangling somewhere between fact and fiction, about some of the most famous figures in mathematics and the natural sciences: Schrödinger, Grothendieck, Heisenberg, even Einstein makes a fleeting appearance. <i>When We Cease to Understand the World</i> has no biographical or historiographical intentions, nor is it a purely literary fabrication. Rather, it circles around one particular experience, that of scientists trembling at the edge of the abyss that is their mind. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>There is the story of Fritz Haber, a not particularly famous but should-be-famous figure, a chemist who invented both the industrial nitrogen fertilizer that is responsible for half of the food consumed by today’s population worldwide and the poisonous gases used first in the trenches of World War I and then in the Nazi death camps. It’s what you might call a mixed record, but Haber’s true nightmare in his later years, as Labatut tells it, was the vision of an earth overgrown by plants on nitrogen hyperdrive, slowly closing in and suffocating all of human civilization. In another story, the mathematician Grothendieck becomes obsessed with the idea that mathematics might cause unspeakable damage to society, radically renounces his mathematical past and adopts the lifestyle of a wandering, peace-preaching hermit. Both Haber and Grothendieck come to live in fear of the power of science, which, like the sorcerer’s apprentice, they have unleashed but cannot control. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The stories of Schwarzschild, De Broglie, Schrödinger and Heisenberg are different: all of them being physicists grappling with the mysteries of relativity and quantum mechanics, they fear the havoc that science might wreak in their own minds. Their theories show a world that no longer makes sense, and what is terrifying is not that these theories are false but that they are true. The world does not make sense anymore. Scientific explanations have become unexplainable. We have arrived at a view of the world which is so close up that we cannot recognize anything anymore, a view which is irreconcilable with the world we live in but which must be the truth, so we must live in the lie.</p> 

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>There is so much in this book to make fun of if you wanted to. Labatut’s scientists are haunted, pursued by demons, battling with insomnia, migraines, fevers, tuberculosis and various unusually unpleasant mental states. They have a tendency to take long walks alone, preferably at night or during thunderstorms. They are single-mindedly devoted to their theories and calculations. Their insights come to them in physically painful flashes, taking hold of them, possessing them, a force overwhelming them from the outside, the way the ancients attributed creative inspiration to the Muses. Labatut does not feel obliged to adhere to historical reality and why should he. This is not a biography, but a text that tries to understand what it would mean to think so hard that the world falls out of your head. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I have an odd and random postscript to add to this post (no pun intended) concerning the physicist De Broglie, who plays a rather minor role in a story that is largely about Schrödinger and Heisenberg. De Broglie was one of the participants at the conference at which the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics began to emerge as a broad consensus. Labatut tells the story of how at this conference, De Broglie presented his own interpretation of quantum mechanics, which convinced nobody except Einstein (and this, arguably, only because Einstein famously hated the Copenhagen interpretation and was willing to bet his money on literally anything else). De Broglie, disappointed and humiliated, remained silent for the rest of the conference. Having reached peak-fame a few years earlier with his doctoral thesis for which he would later receive the Nobel prize, he went on to live a life of moderate prestige, without any major insights or breakthroughs, hiding, as Labatut says, for the rest of his life behind a veil of shame.</i></p> 

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>This story broke my heart, more than anything has done for a while. While writing up this post, I checked De Broglie’s Wikipedia entry. His interpretation of quantum mechanics was indeed first dismissed but then later revived during his lifetime. It never became widely accepted but he continued pursuing it, alongside a few other people. He went on to do a bunch of stuff. He received a prize from the UNESCO for popularizing scientific knowledge. One must imagine De Broglie happy. At least I choose to do so. </i></p>
