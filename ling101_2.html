<p><b>Linguistics 101: What linguists disagree on (vol. I)</b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>This is the second instalment of Linguistics 101, in which I try to summarize (for non-linguists) what I consider the two big questions linguists disagree on. (These two questions are often conflated into one. I don’t find this helpful. Which is not to say that my way of separating them is mindblowingly insightful or anything.) I am splitting this post into two parts because it got longer than anticipated. </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>I would also like to note that I feel very weird explaining things that are very familiar to a lot of people, including non-linguists, especially because I myself absolutely loathe being explained things I already know. I am trying to overcome this feeling-weird-ness by reminding myself that this is just a writing exercise and imagining a fictitious audience who has just crawled out of some intellectual cave (or is just very young).</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Just like any other discipline, linguistics consists of different schools, factions and cliques which disagree on some fundamental (as well as some trivial) issues. There are two big points of contention I would like to single out. This post will deal with the first question, which is fairly well-known. In vol. II, we’ll then get into the second, less prominent question and discuss how the two are related.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The first question concerns innateness. To understand what is at stake here, let’s go back in time to the fifties and to probably the most brutal intellectual take-down in the history of cognitive science so far and ever since. In 1959, Noam Chomsky, who ended up being the most influential (theoretical, I-language) linguist of the 20th century, writes a review of B.F. Skinner’s book <i>Verbal Behavior</i>. Skinner is the figurehead of the leading school in psychology at the time, known as behaviorism, and generally a fairly important guy. The bulk of Skinner’s research had been concerned with very simple learning mechanisms in non-human animals, like rats figuring out that they can get food by pressing a certain button but not another. (Think Pavlov’s dog, if that helps.) It is by the very same mechanism, according to Skinner according to Chomsky, that infants learn language. A child that repeatedly receives positive feedback when saying ‘dog’ while pointing at a dog (‘Yes, this is a doggie!’), and negative feedback when saying ‘cat’ in the same scenario will eventually learn to associate the word ‘dog’ with the image of a dog, the same way that Skinner’s rats learned to associate a certain button with food, and perhaps another button with a painful electric shock. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>


<p>The point Chomsky makes is that this view on language acquisition is woefully inadequate for a number of reasons, not all of which I can go through here. For a start, the linguistic input children receive is actually pretty scant considering the enormous amount of things to learn. If you have ever (successfully or not) tried to learn a foreign language, you know that just seeing a new word once or twice hardly ever makes it stick in your memory (and the same holds for rats and buttons), but it seems that for infants, this is all it takes. What is more, the input is noisy: people misspeak all the time, as when someone says ‘The nut next to the acorns look pretty appetizing.’ (If this sentence seems fine, read it again.) Learning French with a textbook full of errors would, to put it mildly, be a challenge, but infants don’t seem to be bothered. Finally and perhaps most importantly, Chomsky argues that children don’t receive negative evidence. Here’s an example of where negative evidence seems crucial (recall from the first 101 post that the asterisk marks an unnatural, ungrammatical sentence): </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>


<p>(1a) I gave the book to my friend. </p>

<p>(1b) I gave my friend the book. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>(2a) I donated the book to the library. </p>

<p>(2b) *I donated the library the book.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Assuming that our language-learning infant has heard (1a), (1b) and (2a), they should very reasonably assume that (2b) is an option as well. It is true that they have never heard anyone actually say it. However, I bet that you have also never heard the sentence ‘My pet squirrel just came back from salsa class’ before, but that doesn’t mean that you consider it ungrammatical. The question is hence how you and every other native speaker of English ever figured out that (2b) is strictly not a possible sentence of English, rather than being a possible sentence that just happened to not have been in your input. In your French classes, your teacher would point out your mistake to you, but parents, Chomsky argues, don’t usually spend their days correcting their toddlers’ grammar (and it is true that they have other things to do).</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>This is where we finally get to the first point of contention dividing the field of linguistics. The reason why, according to Chomsky, infants learn language effortlessly from very little, noisy input without negative evidence is because language is innate. A lot of your linguistic knowledge doesn’t need to be learned in the first place because it is already hard-wired in your brain when you’re born. Learning (your first, native) language is not like learning French or Morse code or how to play the ukulele, but it is more like learning how to see. Visual perception is obviously part of your genetic endowment as a human being, but you actually need experience and practice in early childhood to learn how to see properly. Very young children are not good at distinguishing objects, understanding three dimensions, and so on – to some extent, vision is a skill that needs to be learned. By the same token, Chomsky claims, you are born with an innate language faculty that only needs to be activated by linguistic input. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>This idea has been as influential as it has been divisive. The backlash against it comes from various sides. Some have argued that Chomsky underestimates the amount of negative evidence that children do receive. Imagine a toddler declaring that they have donated the library a book. Their parents will probably not take this as an opportunity to discuss the dative alternation with their offspring but they might reasonably respond by saying ‘Oh, you donated <i>a book to the library</i>?’, emphasizing the part of the sentence that the child got wrong. This is not explicit correction, but you can imagine kids picking up on this. Another, fairly successful anti-innateness argument has been that children can learn in the absence of negative evidence by relying on Bayesian statistics. Very roughly, if you never see something that you would expect to see frequently, at some point you’ll figure out that it might just not exist. (I don’t really want to get into the details here.) There is also the argument that after all, large language models like ChatGPT manage to learn language without any innate or hard-wired grammar. (I very much don’t want to get into this. It might be a topic for a future post.) </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The controversy is ongoing, but pretty much everyone these days agrees that human language acquisition can’t just be like Skinner’s rats-and-buttons-style learning. Something else needs to be said. Something needs to enable infants to learn so effortlessly from so little input, whether that’s genetics or sophisticated statistical learning mechanisms, and a whole lot of intellectual energy in contemporary linguistics goes into finding out what this something is. You can think about Chomsky’s merits as a linguist whatever you like, but you got to give him credit for raising this question in the first place. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The debate surrounding innateness is often framed as a yes-or-no question, but it very much is not: it is not about whether language is innate but to what extent language is innate, which of its aspects are innate. You can imagine a spectrum of possible opinions here. At one end, one might argue that all of linguistic knowledge is hard-wired. This would be a ludicrous position. Nobody would claim that lexical knowledge, such as what the word ‘squirrel’ means, is innate. Chomsky and his followers maintain the slightly more modest claim that, roughly speaking, we need to learn words but that we are born with very rich syntactic knowledge that tells us how to combine these words into sentences. You can also imagine someone occupying a middle ground: maybe only the very basics of language are innate, such as the concepts of nouns, verbs and adjectives. Or maybe (moving even further towards the other end of the spectrum) what is actually innate are the concepts of entities, activities and properties, which linguistically correspond to nouns, verbs and adjectives, respectively. That is, linguistic innate knowledge might be reducible to more general innate knowledge that is needed in other domains of cognition as well. The other extreme end of the spectrum – that nothing about language is innate – is, to my knowledge, only occupied by some AI tech bros who crunch a few billion data points and declare to have solved language, which is not a position worth considering. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>To some extent, which of all of those views is on the right track can be and is investigated empirically. However, there are some conceptual puzzles as well. We know far too little about both genetics and the brain to actually have a concrete idea of what it would mean for some piece of knowledge to be innate. What we work with, in practice, is rather some kind of operative definition specifying the conditions under which innate knowledge needs to be assumed. A simple view would be that we should consider something innate knowledge if it can be observed even in the absence of relevant experience. For instance, if babies knew instinctively that squirrels are called squirrels without ever witnessing any squirrel-themed conversation, this knowledge would have to be somehow hard-wired. In practice, however, this simple idea doesn’t really work. Even hardcore Chomskyans would arguably agree that innate knowledge still needs to be activated by linguistic experience to become operative (kind of like the diathesis-stress model in psychology if absolutely everyone was stressed). If you grow up being deprived of all linguistic input, you simply won’t be able to form any syntactically correct sentences, regardless of the amount of a priori syntax you might bring to the table. The view defended by Chomskyans is thus rather that we should consider something innate knowledge if it is not sufficiently explained by experience alone. This is an argument for the innateness theory only in the sense that it is an argument against the alternative, experience-only theory, and that from not not-p, it follows that p. It is not clear to me whether there could be any direct, positive evidence for the innateness theory. At the same time, it has long been pointed out that just because something can be learned from experience, that doesn’t mean that it necessarily is learned rather than innate. In short, while empirical work is important, it is not always clear what conclusions we can draw from it. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I feel that the previous paragraph isn’t quite as clear and simple as the Linguistics 101 series generally aspires to be, but it’s getting late and this post is getting too long, so I’m wrapping this up. I might write a follow-up on innateness at some point. So far, I hope to have gotten the point across that ‘Is language innate?’ is a hopelessly simplistic question to ask, and that investigating the genetic underpinnings of the language faculty isn’t just a matter of running some experiments but quickly gets you sucked into the big conceptual black holes in cognitive science. In the next Linguistics 101 post, we’ll turn to the second big issue that linguists lose sleep over, or at least they should. Unlike the innateness question which is invariably covered in every linguistics intro textbook, the second question is usually not discussed as explicitly, although in my humble opinion, it is the more interesting one.  </p>
