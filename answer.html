<p><b>An answer to a question I got recently</b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Someone asked me what excites me about linguistics. I was too tired to give a real response at the time, so I am trying to write a better one now.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>I love linguistics but would readily admit that I ended up where I am in part for perfectly contingent reasons. I was a CompLit major in college, one of those open-ended liberal arts that scoff at the idea of making students <i>learn</i> anything in the strict sense but are rather guided by the mission of teaching students how to <i>think</i>. (Which is not actually something I mean to mock.) I did learn how to think eventually (I think) and figured it might be interesting to have something to think about. I was envisaging something serious, like science. Linguistics seemed to vaguely fit my interests and aptitudes, and besides, there are not a whole lot of other science-like graduate programs you can get in with a CompLit degree. I had a somewhat limited understanding of what linguistics is before entering the field, and the areas I was planning to specialize in (semantics, pragmatics) are very much not the areas I work in now. The fact that linguistics ended up suiting me well anyway was, by and large, a happy accident. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I don’t think of linguistics as my one true calling. There are fairly deep-seated reasons for why I’m not a dentist or a farmer or a psychotherapist, but in some possible worlds not too far from this one I might be a mathematician or a philosopher or a biologist. What I care about, at the end of the day, is not allomorphy, head bundling or suspended affixation (which are very fun and interesting things in their own right, but so is everything if viewed from the right perspective) but the more abstract issues they allow us to make sense of. I’m by no means opposed to philosophy, but sometimes the best way to approach a Big Question is not by brute-force head-on contemplation but by starting out in the thickest empirical weeds of things and then working your way from there. Which can be fun and interesting or frustrating and tedious, depending on the day. Linguistics largely just happens to be the particular weeds I work with. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Contingency aside, there is something about linguistics that sets it apart from many other fields (although it shares this property with, for example, neuroscience). Linguistics, as a cognitive science, is very young. It is a field not so much concerned with adding to an already existing accumulated body of knowledge than with figuring out what the hell we are talking about in the first place. Which is not to say that there is no such thing as a ruling paradigm, but overall, the ground is shakier than in other disciplines. What is exciting about linguistics, to finally answer somebody’s question, is precisely this shaking ground. You never know where you’re at. The kind of science I’m interested in is someone taking the picture you have of some piece of reality, rearranging the parts, turning it on its head and then handing it back to you, and you’re like, oh, I never thought about it that way.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I am what you might call genetically predisposed to have an intuitive perspective on things that differs from the majority’s intuitive perspective on things. The way most people structure their experience does not make a whole lot of sense to me. This doesn’t exactly make everyday life easier but on the bright side, it means that I have a fairly decent awareness of the fact that our way of seeing the world is exactly this, a way of seeing the world. (Which is one of those insights that are easy to grasp and might seem obvious and cliché but are much harder to actually integrate into your intellectual default setting.) The world I live in is very fluid. Everything is up for debate all the time. Research is the only area I am aware of in which debating everything and calling into question people’s most basic assumptions is not considered rude or obnoxious or weird, and that’s kind of nice and exciting I suppose. </p>


<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I was halfway through this post when I realized I might have actually misinterpreted the question I was asked. If I remember correctly, the question was what excites me about my PhD, which is not quite the same. Maybe I was expected to talk about how much I enjoy travelling to conferences or teaching undergrads and the like. It’s just that I would consider this more personal question about as interesting as the question of what I eat for breakfast, so I won’t answer it here.</i></p>
