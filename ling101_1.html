<p><b>Linguistics 101: What linguists do</b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>New series! Linguistics 101 will be a couple of posts about linguistics aimed primarily at non-linguists. I don’t have much of a plan yet as to what concretely I’ll cover. My goal here is also to practice writing in a way that is actually easy to read. This first post deals with the very basics: what linguistics is about and how linguists spend their time.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>The field of linguistics, as you have probably guessed, is the study of language. Specifically, linguists are concerned with natural human languages such as English, Hindi, Turkish and Navajo. Some linguists also work on animal communication, but this is pretty niche. Artificial languages such as programming languages or Morse code are not usually considered part of the domain of linguistics.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>There are many different ways in which you can approach language. People often think that linguists study how different languages are related to each other and how languages evolve over time. There are some who do, but this is by far not the whole of linguistics. Some linguists are interested in how babies learn their first language or how language is processed in the brain. Others try to understand how language is used in communication and social interaction – how can ‘It’s a bit chilly in here, isn’t it?’ come to mean ‘Please close the window’? Some linguists work on the nitty-gritty acoustics of speech sounds and how exactly your tongue moves when you produce a particular sound. Yet another area deals with the broader societal and political dimensions of language. For instance, if you live in the US, should you have the right to file your tax returns in Spanish? And so on and so forth – this is a very incomplete list, and I couldn’t give you a complete list if I tried. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>By the same token, how linguists spend their time on a day-to-day basis varies widely (although I suppose we all read papers and write emails.) Many linguists gather empirical evidence for their research from questionnaires, behavioral experiments or even neuroimaging techniques. Others spend their days scribbling obscure formulas on whiteboards and staring at them for a very long time, and yet others go out into the world to document languages at risk of going extinct. Among the fields that have some sort of connection to linguistics are psychology, neuroscience, computer science, mathematics, logic, philosophy, political science, sociology and literary studies. In short, linguistics is a lot of different things.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>To get a somewhat clearer sense of the field as a whole, it might be helpful to draw two distinctions. The first distinction, and a fairly obvious one, is that between theoretical and applied linguistics. While many linguists work with the goal of gaining a purely theoretical understanding of what language is and how it works, this understanding can also be put to use in order to solve real-world problems. For instance, you might think of speech-language pathology (helping people with speech or language disorders), forensic linguistics (assessing linguistic evidence used in court cases), language engineering (developing tools such as Alexa, DeepL or ChatGPT), and many more. These are not fields I work in, and I will have nothing to say about applied linguistics in the remainder of this series. However, this does not imply that it is not interesting or not important. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The second, slightly less obvious distinction I’d like to draw here is that between so-called E-language and I-language. You can think of ‘E’ and ‘I’ as standing for ‘external’ and ‘internal’ (although these letters are occasionally interpreted differently). It is important to understand that E-language and I-language are not different <i>things</i>. Rather, they are different ways of looking at the same thing, namely, language. E-language is language understood as a cultural, social and political entity, something that evolves over centuries, is passed down from one generation to another, has a certain legal status in a given country, is part of a national or regional culture, and so on. E-language, in other words, is something that exists in the space between us. I-language, on the other hand, exists inside our heads. I-language is language understood as a psychological entity. You and probably everyone around you know at least one language. This knowledge is your own personal I-language. It came into existence when you were born (or maybe a bit earlier, depending on what you think about language acquisition!), now lives somewhere in your brain and will die with you. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>This kind of knowledge that I-linguists are interested in is crucially <i>implicit</i>. For instance, you know that ‘The squirrel is hungry’ is an English sentence while *‘Squirrel hungry is the’ is not. (In linguistics, we use the asterisk to mark an ungrammatical, i.e., weird or unnatural sentence. I might talk more about this in a future post.) You know this very intuitively and you may have a hard time explaining why this is the case. It immediately feels wrong – it’s just not a sentence. There are other kinds of knowledge that I-linguists don’t care very much about. For example, you might have learned that ‘squirrel’ is a noun, that English is an Indogermanic language or that you shouldn’t end a sentence with a preposition. This is not intuitive knowledge but merely language-related information that you stuffed into your head at some point. It is not part of your I-language. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>It should have become clear by now that I-linguistics is part of the broader field of cognitive science. We are interested in language as something that your mind can do, much as other cognitive scientists are interested in vision, rational inference or spatial cognition. When we ask what language is like we want to know what it is like <i>inside your head</i>, what form your linguistic knowledge takes. As you can imagine, this is a highly abstract endeavor, and this is part of what makes this particular area of linguistics so interesting. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>It should also have become clear by now that I am an I-linguist, and I will write from this perspective for most, if not all, of this series. E-language is real and exciting and very much worth our time, but it is just not something I have much expertise on. Whenever I talk about linguistics in an upcoming post I will, unless otherwise noted, mean theoretical I-linguistics. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The next post will discuss two major theoretical debates in linguistics that some of us have very strong feelings about. In subsequent instalments, I might write a bit more concretely about some subfields of linguistics that I work on, in particular syntax and morphology. Mostly, though, I am interested in thinking about some of the broader questions you face when trying to develop a theory of linguistic knowledge – which is a theory of a theory? Thorny questions ahead.  </p>
