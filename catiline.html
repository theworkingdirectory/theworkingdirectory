<p><b>Book miniatures: Sallust, <i>De coniuratione Catilinae</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I’ve been thinking that it would be fun to post something about each book I read. I originally decided to call this series book miniatures because I was planning to limit each post to 400 words in order to turn this into a sort of writing challenge. While this first episode of the series strictly adheres to this rule, I suspect that I will end up finding the word limit frustrating and counterproductive, and since this is my blog and I can do what I want, I might loosen this restriction in future episodes.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>There is another complication about this first book miniature, which is that my Oxford edition publishes De coniuratione Catilinae together with the Bellum Iugurthinum (plus a series of fragments and speeches I can’t be bothered to read). I’ve decided that the structural unity of the text should take precedence over the material unity of the codex, so I’m treating the Catiline text as deserving its own post. Stay tuned for the Jugurthine War.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>De coniuratione Catilinae</i> is the story of a failed coup d’état in the late Roman republic, featuring everything you’d expect from the late republic: a charismatic supervillain, deeply entrenched social conflicts, a who’s who of famous late republicans, military battles, rhetorical battles, and a narrator who can’t stop reminiscing about the good old times and complaining about kids these days. Catiline is a Roman nobleman, smart, shrewd, audacious, but also wicked, depraved and lusting for power (as most kids these days). After failing several times to get himself elected consul, he decides to take a more hands-on approach to his claim to total world domination and assembles a group of conspirators seeking to overthrow the senate. Catiline’s allies and followers, besides some straightforwardly wicked, depraved and power-lusting degenerates, are largely recruited from disenfranchised demographics understandably dissatisfied with the status quo, viz., women, slaves, oppressed tribes from the provinces heavily burdened by debt, etc. The senate, with Cicero as consul, soon becomes aware of the conspiracy but is powerless in the absence of concrete proof. The plot thickens, Catiline secretly assembles an army outside of Rome, Cicero pulls all strings available, and eventually the conspiracy is officially revealed with the help of some Gaullian tribe who the conspirators attempt to bribe but who let themselves be bribed by the senate instead, which is indeed probably the safer bet. With Catiline still outside Rome, the senate debates the fate of the conspirators captured so far. The law mandates exile, not execution, but for obvious reasons nobody feels great about this. Caesar pleads for clemency (of course) and argues that unconstitutionally executing citizens is a slippery slope towards future abuses of power; Cato pleads for being tough on crime (of course) and wants everyone to die. I feel Caesar has a point here but the senate feels differently and executions take place. In the end, Catiline’s armies are defeated, he himself dying heroically on the battlefield, <i>ferociam[…] animi quam habuerat vivus in voltu retinens</i>. The disenfranchised are as powerless as ever. There is something quite timely in the story of a populist megalomaniac rising to power by feeding on legitimate discontent among the powerless, but unlike some contemporary farcical figures, Catiline ultimately emerges, despite Sallust’s moralizing, as a tragic hero achieving some sort of greatness in his wickedness. </p>
